    <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
<p> Hey, here you can learn a little about me. From My favorite website, to three things im intrested in. This is all about me Kuldip Sahota, and Shrek of course. I live in Canada and have active hobbies such as gaming and reading. I also have been into web design since 10th grade, and have given it a shot for the past for weeks trying to learn. Though its not so easy im still giving it as much time as I can. </p>
